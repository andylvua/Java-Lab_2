In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip,
which is a 2.5-mile stretch of shopping, entertainment venues,
luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most
commonly visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at nighttime looks
especially beautiful. All the buildings light up with bright, neon,
eye-catching signs to attract visitors attention.
